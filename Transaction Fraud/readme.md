Goal: build a machine learning model to predict the probability that the first transaction of a new user is fradulent

### Agenda:<br/>
1.Determine each user's country based on the numeric IP address<br/>
2.Build a model to predict if an activity is fraudulent or not <br/>
- How different assumptions about the cost of false positives vs false negatives would impact the model
3. Explain how the model predicts from the user perspective?<br/>
- What kind of characteristics are more likely to be classified as at risk?<br/>
4. Explain how a user would use the model from the producttive perspective? = What kind of different user experiences would you build based on the model output?<br/>
